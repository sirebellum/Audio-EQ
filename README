Set of scripts written to stream raw audio data via udp packets. (WAV files contain raw audio as data, so "raw audio" and "wav" are used somewhat interchangeably)

Description of files:
 Final.py - Receives udp packets and plays audio. Usage: "python3 Final.py"
  myfunctions.py - clipping function
  streaming.py - receive udp wav stream (class)

 led.py - Turn on LED at RPi. Usage: "python led.py"

 stream.sh - uses gstreamer to stream mic or wav file Usage: "./stream.sh IP_ADDRESS [optional_wav_file]"

IP addresses within Final.py and led.py need to be changed as needed.
